# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset

## 🔍 Objective
To implement the KNN algorithm for a multi-class classification problem using the famous Iris dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset.
- 150 samples, 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
2. Normalized features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Trained `KNeighborsClassifier` for K = 1 to 20.
4. Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Visualized accuracy vs. K plot to choose best K.

## 📈 Results
- Best K: 1
- Accuracy: 97% (varies by random state)

## ✅ Conclusion
KNN performs very well on the Iris dataset with proper normalization. Accuracy is sensitive to choice of K.
